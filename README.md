## Welcome to The Lost Island!
Once a tropical paradise in the middle nowhere, but due to climate changes and the melting ice caps the rising waters are eating away at the shore.  Save as many as you can, but also remember to save yourself.

A rescue helicopter hangs over the farthest tip of the island, and it is your job to guide your fellow villagers to safety.

Listen for the screams of your fellow villagers to find them and save them, before they perish. But remember that if you stay in the water for too long you too might perish.
